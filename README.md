WEEK -1:
# Crop-and-Fertilizer-Recommendation 
Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation
**Description**  
A system designed to suggest the most appropriate crops by analyzing environmental and soil characteristics, including temperature, soil pH, rainfall, humidity, and nutrient concentrations like nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus.  

**Features**  
- Analysis of temperature data  
- Measurement of soil pH levels  
- Monitoring of rainfall patterns  
- Tracking of humidity levels  
- Evaluation of soil nutrient content (Nitrogen, Potassium, Phosphorus)  

WEEK -2:
1. **Handling Missing Values**  
   - If any null values were found in Week 1, handle them using imputation techniques (mean, median, mode) or by removing rows/columns if necessary.  

2. **Feature Engineering & Selection**  
   - Identify relevant features affecting soil and fertilizer recommendations (e.g., pH levels, nitrogen content, phosphorus, potassium).  
   - Remove irrelevant or highly correlated features to prevent redundancy and improve model performance.  

3. **Data Normalization & Scaling**  
   - Normalize numerical values to bring them within a similar range for better model accuracy (e.g., Min-Max Scaling, Standardization).  

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Generate graphs such as histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps to understand feature distributions and relationships.  

5. **Outlier Detection & Removal**  
   - Use statistical methods (like Z-score, IQR) or visualization techniques (boxplots) to detect and handle outliers that may skew the model.  

6. **Initial Data Splitting**  
   - Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to prepare for model training in future weeks.
